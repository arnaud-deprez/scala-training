	// private[com] whatever will allow access to this thingy to anything com and narrower. The scope of 'com' depends on

	// Good. Bad. It's all a matter of subjective perspective (opinion). I would be careful with this one. Because so
	// many package names are being mashed into the current context, you might quickly start to run into collision
	// problems. But sometimes we're lazy. And sometimes being lazy turns out okay. Sometimes it doesn't, and you end up
	// doing more work to fix the problems caused by the early laziness.
